ViMbAdmin :: Virtual Mailbox Administration
============================================

The **ViMbAdmin** project (*vim-be-admin*) provides a web based virtual mailbox administration system to allow mail administrators to easily manage domains, mailboxes and aliases. 

**ViMbAdmin** was written in PHP using our own web application framework which includes the Zend Framework, the Doctrine ORM and the Smarty templating system with JQuery and Bootstrap.

**ViMbAdmin** is hosted on its own GitHub project page where you can find documentation, browse the source code and access our Git repository. We have also set up a Google Groups discussion group or you can follow the [blog posts](http://www.barryodonovan.com/index.php/category/vimbadmin-2) on our MD's personal site.
