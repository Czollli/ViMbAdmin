            <h3>Step 1: Security Salt</h3>
            
            <p>
            A <em>security salt</em> is used to ensure your administrator passwords are
            secure. You must first set a random security salt in the <code>securitysalt</code>
            parameter in the following file: <code>application/config/application.ini</code>.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            We suggest you use the following <strong>randomly generated</strong> string:
            </p>
            
             <pre>{$randomSalt}</pre>
        
            <p>
                <strong>Please also ensure you have set all the appropriate values
                in the <code>[user]</code> section before continuing.</strong>
            </p>

        <h3>Step 2: Create a New Administrator</h3>
        
            <p>
            You now need to create a super administrator who can log into the system.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            To ensure only the person installing this application can register the user,
            you must enter the security salt as you entered it into the file above. If you
            chose to use the random string then it has been copied below for your convenience.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Enter a username (which must be your email address) and a password. You will be
            emailed you a copy of this password to the email address provided you have set
            your mail settings in <code>application.ini</code>.

    <h3>Developer Pingback</h3>
    
    <p>
    Please note that when you successfully complete the above step, the system makes a
    <em>pingback</em> to <tt>stats.opensolutions.ie</tt> to notify the developers
    that there is a new install.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>We are only interested in counting the install
    base to know if further development and support of this open source project is
    worthwhile.</strong>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    {if isset( $options.skipInstallPingback ) and $options.skipInstallPingback}
        <span class="label label-important">WARNING</span>
        <strong>You have DISABLED the pingback. Please reconsider or drop us a
        mail to let us know you are using it and what you think!</strong>
    {else}
        You can disable this by setting <code>skipInstallPingback = 1</code> in your
        <code>application.ini</code> file.
